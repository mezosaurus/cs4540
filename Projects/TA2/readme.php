					<h2> Design Decisions </h2>
					<p> TA Application </p>
					<ul>
						<li>My application posts to formSubmit.php. I decided to save to the DB and then read from the DB all on one page.</li>
						<li>In the future, the formSubmit.php page that displays all of the submitted information will give the option to the applicant to make changes and re-submit</li>
					</ul>
					<br/>
					<h2> Peer Reviews </h2>
					<p> I did my schema design with Devon Winkler. We did a peer review with Colton Lillywhite and Logan Gore. My feedback for their websites are as follows: </p>
					<ul>
						<h3>Devon Winkler Feedback</h3>
						<li>I like the design. Color scheme is nice and pleasing to the eye. The layout is user friendly.</li>
						<li>A dropdown menu for the assignments would be nice so it doesn't have to redirect to a blank page to then select the specific assignment.</li>
						<li>It would be nice if you could go directly to each class example instead of that default directory page.</li>
						<li>Your form design is really nice. Love that each section is clearly outlined and has a bold header.</li>
					</ul>
					<br/>
					<ul>
						<h3>Colton LillyWhite Feedback</h3>
						<li>I feel like the home page text should be centered on the page instead of aligned to the left.</li>
						<li>Home page needs some extra content and more styling, looks plain.</li>
						<li>It would be nice to be able to go directly to your projects and class examples instead of being directed to the default directory page.</li>
						<li>The color combination for your TA1 site is rough on the eyes. I'm glad you changed it in TA2!</li>
						<li>Content is being hidden by your left menu on the TA2 site.</li>
						<li>Your form is squeezed together, could use some spacing between fields so it's easier to fill in the form.</li>
					</ul>
					<br/>
					<ul>
						<h3>Logan Gore Feedback</h3>
						<li>Class examples directs to an ugly looking directory page, would be nice if you could have some sub-menu to go directly to each examples html page.</li>
						<li>Color scheme feels a bit off. The background color is clashing with the grey information box you have. Maybe you can find a lighter cream color that will be a nice variant on the cream color of the background.</li>
						<li>Your form looks nice, I like the styling of the text fields. Maybe you could reduce the width of them and fit more on the same line? The application feels a bit long to scroll through.</li>
						<li>When you click on the menu links it is opening the html in a new page instead of changing the current page to the new html document.</li>
					</ul>
