				<h1> README TA3 </h1>
				<p class="summary">
					I struggled with this assignment. I spent a TON of time trying to get the sessions working properly,
					and ultimately I ran out of time to get the rest of the stuff done so I apologize for the lack of content.
					I at least attempted to get stubs of all those new pages in, but was unable to get any functionality in there.
					There really isn't much more to say, as I feel my assignment is lacking quite a bit.
